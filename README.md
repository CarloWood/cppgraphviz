# cppgraphviz submodule

This repository is a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
providing classes that allow tracking object instances, either separately, as members
of other classes or as element of an STL container and presenting their relationship
in a graph.

* Graph
* GraphTracker
* RectangleNode
* Class
* IndexedContainerSet
